## Desription of App Functionality, Features, and Methods

Javascript project I complete from Udemy Course - Javascript - The Complete Guide 2023 by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. After coding this project I added some minor changes and added extensive commenting for educational purposes.

App can be run from: https://frank-pechar-js-fav-movie-list.netlify.app/

## This App Uses Javascript Features Such As:

- Basic DOM manipulation and data entry using modals and class manipulation
- Tested and used varous DOM traversal and selection techniques
- Removed event listener on bound function by recreating DOM element and pointing to new element for new event listener therby letting old event listener become garbage collected
